# RBC_Customer_Churn_Analysis

Customer churn or customer attrition is a tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business or organization. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s services or products during a specific period is called a customer churn rate. Several bad experiences (or just one) are enough, and a customer may quit. And if a large chunk of unsatisfied customers churn at a time interval, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

RowNumber—corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.

CustomerId—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.

A recurring deposit is best for those who prefer to invest small amounts.}
